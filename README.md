## FAQ

### What is this written in?

Vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

### How does it work?

[d2.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@terrastruct/d2) serves every request for dagre and
elk layouts all within the frontend client. To render
[tala](https://d2lang.com/tour/tala/) layouts, a request is made to an API (since it's not
supported by `d2.js`.

### Can I run it locally?

Yes. Just clone and follow the instructions in the Development section below.

## Development

Just run `./ci/dev.sh`.

### Prerequisites

- `esbuild`:

## Dependencies

External dependencies are kept to a minimum. Currently they are:
1. [Monaco Editor](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor) for text editing features.
1. [Panzoom](https://github.com/anvaka/panzoom) for SVG navigation.

Both are not ideal. Monaco is unnecessarily heavy and Panzoom lacks scrolling. The plan is
to replace these one day.

If you're a contributor, please do not add any dependencies without discussing first.
